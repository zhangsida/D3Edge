Developing a D3.js Edge
=======================

This repository contains code and snippets that accompany the Developing a 
D3.js Edge book from Bleeding Edge Press (http://bleedingedgepress.com).

Once you clone or download this repository, from the root of its directory you can
simply launch a web server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` on a mac. Then, you can 
navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and explore both the demo applications
for each chapter, and the code snippets. 

On windows 7 and the current python version needed: python -m http.server 8000
